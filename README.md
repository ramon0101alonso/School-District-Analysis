# School District Analysis Overview
## I will be providing Maria with new math and reading scores for Thomas High School after I replace the 9th graders  with a score of NaN. The score comparison will inform the school board if there has been dishonesty in the scoring of these two subjects.  

# Results
## How is the district summary affected?
###### After replacing the 9th grade scores with Nan, the change in the overal 15 schools was insignificant.  The links will show how average math scores dropped by 0.1%, and the reading and math passing rate dropped by 0.1%.

## How is the school summary affected?
###### Thomas Jefferson Students who passed math dropped from 93% to 70%.  Those who passed reading, the score changed from 97% to 70%.  The charts below show these changes.  Below are the links that represent this data.

## How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
###### After replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores, Thomas High School is no longer in the top five schools.  Here are the charts before and after.

## By replacing the ninth-grade scores this is the affect it has on the following:
###### Math and reading scores by grade.  Only ninth graders' scores dropped after replacing them with Nan.

# Summary
###### In conclusion, replacing the scores for ninth graders is a great way to discover inconsistencies in math and reading scores.  Charted schools have an overall higher scoring rate than Distric Schools.  Spending on students did not show a significant differance in scores.  Finally, the change in the 15 schools was insignificant.
